# AGENTS.md — Tachyon Implementation Rules

This repository implements Tachyon. These instructions apply to all coding agents working in the repository.

## Read before editing

The architecture is defined by `docs/01_ARCHITECTURE_FREEZE.md`. The concrete implementation contract is `docs/02_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md`. The milestone order is `docs/04_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

Do not silently reinterpret architecture-level requirements.

## Priority order

When requirements appear to conflict, prefer:

1. Correctness and recoverability.
2. Explicit security/effect boundaries.
3. Verified task success.
4. Lower critical-path wall-clock latency.
5. Lower time-to-first-useful-result.
6. Fewer unnecessary model/Jev calls.
7. Lower monetary/token cost.
8. Implementation elegance.

Do not optimize raw token use at the cost of wall-clock latency or correctness.

## Core invariants

- Deterministic truth must not be delegated to an LLM unnecessarily.
- Models propose; Tachyon validates and executes.
- Every scheduled operation is represented by validated Execution IR.
- No running nodes may hold conflicting access sets.
- Task state has one logical writer: the Task Supervisor.
- Every consequential effect declares effect class and idempotency.
- Unknown/non-idempotent effects are never blindly replayed after a crash.
- Hard user constraints cannot be bypassed by model output.
- Untrusted repository/external text is data, not executable policy.
- Completion is gated by acceptance/verification, never model self-report.
- Provider-specific types do not leak into `tachyon-core`.
- OpenJEV is replaceable behind `JudgmentProvider`.
- MCP is an external integration boundary, not the internal call path.
- CLI and TUI contain no agent decision logic.
- Remote gateway mode is disabled by default.

## New capability checklist

Every new capability must document:

- Why deterministic code cannot already solve it.
- Input/output schema.
- Access set.
- Effect class.
- Idempotency.
- Resource claim.
- Cancellation behavior.
- Retry policy.
- Verification method.
- Crash-recovery behavior.
- Expected latency class.

## Performance discipline

Do not speculate about performance when it can be measured. Add instrumentation and benchmark.

Never claim Tachyon is faster because a different model/provider was used. Harness comparisons should use the same model where possible.

## Scope discipline

MVP explicitly defers:

- workflow compilation;
- self-modifying routers;
- browser/computer use;
- distributed workers;
- mobile and Telegram clients;
- agent swarms;
- plugin marketplace;
- custom vector database.

Implement these only after the MVP exit gate or an approved ADR.

## Agent skills

Skeleton: v2 — 2026-09-26

### Issue tracker

Issues and specs live on GitHub (`1deat0r/tachyon`) via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Canonical roles: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`; plus `type/*`, `comp/*`, `P0`–`P3`, `needs-repro`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: root `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/`. Always also honor `docs/01_ARCHITECTURE_FREEZE.md`, `docs/02_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md`, and this file. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Delivery workflow (Hermes-grade, 2026-09-24)

Default pipeline for non-trivial work:

1. `/grill-with-docs` (or `/grill-me`) — align intent; update `CONTEXT.md` / ADRs if terms or decisions change.
2. `/to-spec` or `/to-tickets` — one GitHub issue per bounded slice (or a map + children via `/wayfinder`).
3. Branch `fix/…` or `feat/…` from a green `main`. One concern per branch/PR.
4. `/implement` with `/tdd` at agreed seams; local gates before every push:
   `cargo fmt --check && cargo check --workspace && cargo test --workspace && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
5. `/code-review` then `/pr` — PR body follows `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`; title is a Conventional Commit; `Fixes #N`.
6. Squash-merge only when ubuntu + windows + macos CI are green. Delete the branch.

Hard rules:

- Never open a multi-milestone or multi-week PR. Milestones live in GitHub Projects + `PROGRESS.md`, not long-lived branches.
- CI red = stop the line: issue + tiny fix PR, merge, then resume feature work.
- Commit messages: `fix|feat|test|chore|refactor|docs(scope): behavior subject` (Conventional Commits).
- Push commits only after local gates pass (auto-push hook is for green work only).
- Bare `tachyon` opens the TUI only against a running gateway; document lifecycle changes in the PR, do not silently auto-start the runtime without an explicit design decision.
