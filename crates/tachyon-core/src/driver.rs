//! ONE shared run driver (M11 plan item 6, core part).
//!
//! The benchmark host and every future supervisor-side caller execute the
//! evidence -> model -> patch -> verification sequence through
//! [`drive`]; there is no second orchestration implementation. The
//! driver runs the worker half of the M10 plan §2 proposal/ack pattern:
//! it proposes run-ID + task-ID + revision-bound messages and the
//! supervisor acknowledges and journals each one before the next stage
//! starts (a stale revision or a foreign task id is a typed error and
//! never a write).
//!
//! Provider-specific types never enter this module: the model interface
//! is the neutral [`ModelProvider`] trait, model names are strings, and
//! journal payloads carry display-relevant fields only (paths + hashes,
//! never source blobs; model answers are redacted before journalling).
